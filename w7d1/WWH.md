# What was hard?

# Why React ?

- Nice and interactive (reactive) interfaces for the web

```js

```

- Problem with jQuery, data is not centralized and we work by modifying elements

```html  
```


- Original React there was no JSX

```js  
```

- Easier because of the component pattern & state

```ejs

```

```jsx

```

- JSX is magical! 

```jsx
```

```html
```
