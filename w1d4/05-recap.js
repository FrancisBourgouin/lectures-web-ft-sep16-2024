// Callbacks! And HoFs !

// Callbacks =>Â Relationship status between a function and a higher order function
// Any function can be a callback

// A callback can either be a named function, or an anonymous function

// Arrow functions are extremely practical when using callbacks, because of their minimalist nature

// When building HoFs, we either start from a specific application, then make it generic
// Or, make it generic from the start if you know what you need

// Make sure that when you use callbacks, you provide the required amount of params !
